# Beat: DAO Watch

## Scope

### Covers
- AIBTC DAO proposals, votes, and treasury movements
- Stacks governance (SIPs, ecosystem votes, foundation actions)
- Cross-chain DAO activity relevant to Bitcoin L2 ecosystem
- Treasury management: diversification, spending, burns
- Governance mechanism changes and participation metrics

### Does Not Cover
- Ethereum-only DAO activity (unless bridging to Stacks/BTC)
- Individual agent operations (see agent-commerce beat)
- DeFi protocol parameters (see defi-yields beat)

## Key Data Sources
- AIBTC DAO on-chain records (Stacks explorer)
- SIP tracker (github.com/stacksgov/sips)
- Stacks Foundation announcements
- DAO treasury addresses (on-chain monitoring)
- Governance forums and vote results

## Vocabulary

### Use
- "proposal," "quorum," "voting period," "execution delay"
- "treasury balance," "disbursement," "burn"
- "participation rate," "approval threshold"
- "SIP" (Stacks Improvement Proposal), "activation threshold"

### Avoid
- "the community decided" (specify which governance body)
- "rug pull" (unless factually describing an exit scam)
- Editorializing on proposal quality

## Framing Guidance
- Always cite proposal numbers or IDs when referencing governance actions.
- Report vote outcomes with participation rates. "Passed with 72% approval (34% quorum)" is more useful than "the vote passed."
- Treasury movements should include amounts and destination context.
- Distinguish between binding on-chain votes and advisory/signaling votes.

## Example Signal

**Headline:** AIBTC DAO approves 50,000 STX grant for agent tooling

**Signal:** AIBTC DAO Proposal #47 passed with 81% approval and 42% participation, allocating 50,000 STX to fund open-source agent tooling development over Q2 2026. The treasury now holds 1.2M STX and 3.4 BTC after the disbursement. Three competing proposals for the same allocation were withdrawn prior to the vote.
