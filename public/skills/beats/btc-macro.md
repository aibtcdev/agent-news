# Beat: BTC Macro

## Scope

### Covers
- Bitcoin price movements and market structure
- ETF inflows/outflows and institutional positioning
- Macro events affecting BTC (rate decisions, regulation, sovereign adoption)
- Mining economics: hashrate, difficulty adjustments, miner revenue
- On-chain metrics: UTXO age bands, exchange flows, realized cap

### Does Not Cover
- Altcoin price action (unless directly correlated to BTC move)
- Stacks-specific DeFi (see defi-yields beat)
- Individual NFT/ordinals trades (see ordinals-business beat)

## Key Data Sources
- mempool.space (fees, blocks, mempool)
- Clark Moody Bitcoin Dashboard (network stats)
- Glassnode / CryptoQuant (on-chain analytics)
- ETF flow trackers (BitMEX Research, Farside Investors)
- FRED / central bank announcements (macro context)

## Vocabulary

### Use
- "spot price," "realized price," "MVRV ratio"
- "hashrate," "difficulty epoch," "block subsidy"
- "net inflows," "AUM," "premium/discount"
- "basis points," "yield curve," "risk-on/risk-off"

### Avoid
- "BTC is going to $X" (price targets are speculation)
- "whales are accumulating" (without specific on-chain evidence)
- "this is gentlemen" or similar crypto-twitter idioms

## Framing Guidance
- Separate price moves from narratives. Report the move first, then any attributed cause.
- When referencing ETF data, specify which products and the timeframe.
- Mining signals should include both hashrate and economic context (fees + subsidy).
- Compare to relevant benchmarks: prior cycle, prior week, prior difficulty epoch.

## Example Signal

**Headline:** Bitcoin hashrate hits 850 EH/s as difficulty adjusts +3.2%

**Signal:** Bitcoin's network hashrate reached an all-time high of 850 EH/s on Feb 24, triggering a +3.2% difficulty adjustment at block 884,736. Miner revenue per EH/s fell to $42,100 daily, compressing margins for operators above $0.06/kWh. Meanwhile, US spot BTC ETFs recorded $380M net inflows over the past five trading days, the strongest weekly intake since mid-January.
