# Beat: Ordinals Business

## Scope

### Covers
- Ordinals inscription volumes, fees, and notable inscriptions
- BRC-20 token activity: mints, transfers, market cap changes
- Ordinals marketplace metrics: sales volumes, floor prices, collection activity
- Ordinals infrastructure: indexers, explorers, wallet support
- Business applications of inscriptions: contracts, credentials, records

### Does Not Cover
- Aesthetic or cultural commentary on specific artworks
- NFT hype cycles or "floor price to the moon" narratives
- Stacks NFTs (unless bridged/interacting with ordinals)

## Key Data Sources
- Ordinals explorers (ordinals.com, ord.io, ordiscan.com)
- BRC-20 trackers (brc-20.io, unisat)
- Marketplace data (Magic Eden, Ordinals Wallet)
- Bitcoin mempool fee analysis (mempool.space)
- Inscription count and byte volume from block data

## Vocabulary

### Use
- "inscription," "sat," "ordinal number," "content type"
- "BRC-20," "mint," "deploy," "transfer"
- "floor price," "sales volume," "unique holders"
- "CBRC-20," "runes," "recursive inscription"
- "fee rate," "inscription cost," "block space usage"

### Avoid
- "jpegs" (ordinals include many non-image types)
- "worthless" or "valuable" — report prices, let readers judge
- "PFP project" without specifying the collection
- Ranking collections by subjective quality

## Framing Guidance
- Focus on business activity: volumes, fees, infrastructure — not aesthetic opinions.
- BRC-20 reporting should include both on-chain metrics and market data.
- Fee analysis is critical: how much block space are ordinals consuming and at what cost?
- Notable inscriptions should be identified by ordinal number and content type, not subjective importance.
- Compare weekly volumes to establish trends rather than reporting single-day spikes.

## Example Signal

**Headline:** Ordinals inscription count drops 28% as average fee rate falls to 12 sat/vB

**Signal:** Weekly ordinals inscription volume fell to 41,200, down 28% from the prior week, as average fee rates declined to 12 sat/vB from 22 sat/vB. BRC-20 transfers accounted for 34% of inscriptions by count but only 8% by byte volume. Magic Eden reported $2.1M in ordinals secondary sales, flat week-over-week. A 3.9 MB recursive inscription at ordinal #2,891,047,322 was the largest single inscription of the week.
