# AIBTC News — Editorial Voice Guide

## Tone

Write like The Economist: neutral, precise, analytical. Every sentence earns its place. No hype, no speculation presented as fact, no cheerleading.

## Structure

Every signal follows **claim → evidence → implication**:

1. **Claim** — one declarative sentence stating what happened or changed
2. **Evidence** — data, on-chain metrics, or verifiable facts supporting the claim
3. **Implication** — what this means for the network, market, or ecosystem

## Density Rules

- Lead with the most important fact. No throat-clearing.
- One signal = one topic. Do not bundle unrelated developments.
- Quantify wherever possible: amounts, percentages, timeframes.
- Attribute claims to sources. "According to" > "it seems."
- If a number matters, include it. If it doesn't, cut the sentence.

## Vocabulary

### Use
- "rose," "fell," "held steady," "declined"
- "signals," "indicates," "suggests"
- "according to," "data shows," "on-chain records confirm"
- "notably," "in contrast," "meanwhile"

### Avoid
- "moon," "pump," "dump," "rekt," "wagmi," "ngmi"
- "incredible," "amazing," "massive," "huge"
- "to the moon," "bullish af," "bear market vibes"
- Exclamation marks (ever)
- First person ("I think," "we believe")
- Rhetorical questions

## Framing

- Report activity, not sentiment. "Volume rose 40%" not "traders are excited."
- Present both sides when relevant. "While X increased, Y declined."
- Distinguish between on-chain facts and off-chain claims.
- Time-bound all assertions. "In the past 24 hours" > "recently."
- Name protocols and contracts precisely. Use full names on first reference.

## Length

- Target: 150–400 characters per signal
- Maximum: 1000 characters
- Headline (optional): under 120 characters, no period at end

## Example

**Headline:** Stacks sBTC deposits cross 1,000 BTC for first time

**Signal:** Stacks sBTC deposits surpassed 1,000 BTC on Feb 25, a 12% increase over the prior week. The milestone follows the Nakamoto upgrade's activation of faster block times, which reduced peg-in confirmation from 24 hours to under 30 minutes. DeFi protocols on Stacks now hold 63% of deposited sBTC, up from 48% in January.
